# podman-desktop

podman-desktop is a graphical menu bar application for managing Podman machines.

Currently, it only supports MacOS using SwiftUI.

podman-desktop is still in its early stages, and should be treated as experimental in its current state. 
At the current moment, it needs HEAVY editing for error handing, state wrestling and window management,
as well as general organization.
